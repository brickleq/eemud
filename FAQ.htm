<p><b><i>When I click 'here' to connect, it gives me an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
is this?</i></b></p>

<p>This means that your web browser does not have a telnet application
reqistered with it. &nbsp;To download a telnet application, go look around
at <a href="http://www.icorp.net/stroud/term.html">Stroud's CWSAPPS List</a>.
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trail.com/~zugg/zmud.html">Zugg's MUD Client</a>,
a telnet application made specialy for MUD playing, is also available.</p>

<p><b><i>I can get connected to the MUD, but when I don't know what name
to enter. &nbsp;Should I use guest or new?</i></b></p>

<p>No. &nbsp;Just enter the name that you wish to use. &nbsp;If it asks
you for a password, that means that the name you want is already taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-login
and try another one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the names from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>
are already taken.</p>

<p><b><i>Once I get connected to the MUD, are there any rules I need to
be aware of?</i></b></p>

<p>YES! &nbsp;Once you are in the game, type 'policy' and hit enter to
view the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignorance is no excuse for breaking them, and
it is your responsibility to be familiar with them.</p>

<p><b><i>I've heard that there is a 'snoop' command that lets immortals
see what I type.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this true?</i></b></p>

<p>Yes, it is. &nbsp;However, only the highest and most trusted immortals
have access to it. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Isn't this a violation of my right to privacy?</i></b></p>

<p>No.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter the MUD, you are on our property.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have a right to monitor any activity on our property. &nbsp;The 'snoop'
command allows us to catch many policy breakers and multiplayers that we
would otherwise not be able to catch, thereby giving you a better, fairer,
cleaner atmosphere to play in.</p>

<p><b><i>Do immortals enjoy killing and freezing players? &nbsp;I've hear
that they do things like that alot...</i></b></p>

<p>No, we don't enjoy punishing players.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often that is the only
way to get a policy breaker to stop bugging people.</p>

<p><b><i>I've read the policy, and it seems that lots of players have no
regard for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that it isn't enforced?</i></b></p>

<p>No, one of the immortals can only be in one place at one time. &nbsp;If
you see the policy being broken, please report the offender.</p>

<p><b><i>The MUD appears as if it is still incomplete.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the zones are not Tolkien-oriented, and some of the spells and skills
are not in full operation. &nbsp;Why is this?</i></b></p>

<p>The MUD is still in the Alpha stage of construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are many thing still to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're working on that as fast
as we can.</p>
