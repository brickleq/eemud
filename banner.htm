<center><p><b><font size="+4">Banners!
<hr width="100%"></font></b>If you own or maintain a web page and are willing
to place an advertisement for Endorian Empires on your page, you will be
rewarded by the Valar.&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we can't afford to pay you, but we
can give you some cool stuff in the game, as well as a link from our page
to yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the banners we have available currently.
&nbsp;More may be added later.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to add one of these
to your page, just <a href="mailto:brick@usit.net?subject=EE Banner">let
us know</a>.</p></center>

<center><p>They are all variations on a theme, as you can tell. &nbsp;The
last is of course the smallest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second to last is the final,
checked-for-errors and condensed and animated version. &nbsp;We may add
more later.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these were done by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990219150725/http://www.uwm.edu/~pandora">Stacey
