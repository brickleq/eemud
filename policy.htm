<h1 align="CENTER">Endorian Empires Policy</h1>

<center><p>
<hr><i>No man is above the law and no man is below it, nor do we ask any
man's permission when we require him to obey it. <br>
Theodore Roosevelt <br>
<br>
It is the duty of a citizen not only to observe the law but to let it be
known that he is opposed to it's violation. <br>
Calvin Coolidge</i> 
<hr></p></center>

<ul>
<center><li>The word of the High Valar is law, even when they appear to
contradict this humble document. All other Valar, Maiar, and Immortals
are to be respected as their agents. If one of them tells you to jump,
ask how high on the way up. Also, if they tell you to cease a certain activity,
do so immediately. There is to be no stealing from immortals, nor bugging
them with stupid questions. They are glad to help if you have a legitimate
problem, but they have very important work to do. If you can find the answer
to your question by any other method (i.e. reading the help files), please
do so. <br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>Player killing is allowed in Endorian Empires, but both parties
must have the pkilling flag set to 'on.' Type 'help pkilling' for more
information on this. Stealing is permitted if both parties have the pkilling
flag on as well. Once you decide to become a pkiller, only one of the High
Valar can turn your pkilling flag off. Note however, that the High Valar
are by no means required to turn your flag off if asked. Hence, think long
and hard before you decide to tread down this path. <br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>Endorian Empires is designed to be fun. So that all players
may enjoy the game, we ask that you treat all your fellow players with
respect. Treat them the way you would like to be treated. Do not flood,
spam, flame, or otherwise harrass or annoy any other players. <br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>Especialy, do not use un-called-for profanity, or sexualy explicit
content while you are here. This is completely unnecessary to the playing
of the game. There are young children who play here, and indecent content
tends to irritate the Powers That Be. Also, do not abuse the shout, say,
gossip, tell, page, echo, gecho, qecho or whisper commands--you are not
entitled to them, and it is perfectly withing the rights of the Valar to
take them from you. <br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>The Immortals here are not allowed to give players stuff, help
players with expericance, etc. Hence, <i>DON'T ASK</i>. If you lose anything
in a crash, the Immortals are not obligated to replace it, so save often.
<br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>If you notice another player breaking any of these rules, please
report them to the Authorities. If you break any of these rules, expect
the swift and sure Justice of the Valar. If you have <i>any</i> questions
about this policy, or if you think it is unclear in any way, or that something
is left out, talk to an Immortal. <br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>There shall be no Multi-playing at <i>ANY</i> time. You may
not have two characters on-line at the same time, using your immortal character
to &quot;beef up&quot; your mortal character, nor using one mortal character
as a storage character. This will be punishable by expulsion, freezing
and/or having all your character's equipment striped. <br>
<br>
</li></center>

<center><li>It is not very polite to advertise other MUDs or games while
enjoying ours. When you log in here to play, you are expected to be in
the pursuit of happiness and not here to distract from the play of others
who are doing the same. The proper place for advertising is in newsgroups;
this is not a newsgroup. </li></center>
