    <h1>Endorian Empires</h1>
    <hr>
       Welcome to the Semi-Official Endorian Empires MUD Home Page.  Endorian 
    Empires is a modified Circle 3.0 Multiple User Dimension based upon the works
    of J.R.R. Tolkien.  It provides a wonderful atmosphere for players to get 
    together and talk, fight, eat, drink, and adventure, and it's all available over
    the Internet, at absolutely no cost whatsoever.  Currently, Endorian Empires 
    is in the Alpha stage of construction, which means that it is still in the very 
    early stages of being built.  Right now there aren't many zones to explore, and
    there are still some major coding projects to be completed.  But not to worry!  
    There is an expert team of builders and coders working 'round the clock to get 
    the MUD ready to be played.
       This does not mean that you can't log on.  Not at all.  You are, in fact, 
    encouraged to.  Telnet to <b>handel.seattleu.edu 7777</b>, and follow the instructions 
    you are given.  Feel free to ask for help: there is a large staff of Immortals just 
    waiting to help out new users.  So enter Endorian Empires...
                          A whole world awaits you.
